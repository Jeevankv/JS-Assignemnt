    <h1>var, let, const</h1>
    <p>var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped.</p><br>
    
    <script>

         var a =10;
         {
             let a = 20; // goes out of scope after this block
             console.log(a); 
         }

         console.log(a); 
    </script>

    <p>Whereas const variable is immutable i.e value cannot be changed but we can add items to it </p><br>
    
    <script>
        const x = 10;
        console.log(10);
        x = 15;  // results an Error 
    </script>

    <script>
        const language = ["c","c++","java"];
        language.push("python","javascript"); // But we can add new items.
        console.log(language); 
    </script>
